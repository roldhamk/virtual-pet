This is a readme for my Manchester Codes virtual pet project.

I will be creating a pet that will::

* Have a name<br>
* Age<br>
* As the pet ages, it's hunger will increase and fitness will decrease<br>
* Pet can be walked to increase fitness<br>
* Pet can be fed to decrease hunger <br>
* Pet can be asked if it needs feeding/walking<br>
* If pet gets too hungry/very unfit it will die<br>
* If pet ages to 30 days old it will die <br>
