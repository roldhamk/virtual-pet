This is a readme for my Manchester Codes virtual pet project.

I will be creating a pet that will do the following:

Have a name 
Ages 
As the pet ages, it's hunger will increase and fitness will decrease
Pet can be walked to increase fitness
Pet can be fed to decrease hunger 
Pet can be asked if it needs feeding/walking
If pet gets too hungry/very unfit it will die
If pet ages to 30 days old it will die
